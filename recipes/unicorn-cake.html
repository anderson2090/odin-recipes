        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the cake mix, water, oil, and eggs with an electric mixer on low speed for 2
                minutes,
                or until well blended.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly into six small bowls. Add a few drops of food coloring to each bowl and stir
                well to get the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.</li>
            <li>Pour the red batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Carefully pour the orange batter over
                the
                red batter and spread it gently. Repeat with the yellow, green, blue, and purple batters, creating six
                layers of colors.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake
                cool
                completely in the pan on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Cut out a circle from the center of the cake, leaving a 2 inch border around the edges. Remove the
                circle
                and save it for later. You should have a ring-shaped cake now.</li>
            <li>Place the cake on a large serving plate. Spread the whipped cream evenly over the top and sides of the
                cake. Sprinkle the rainbow sprinkles over the whipped cream.</li>
            <li>To make the unicorn horn, roll out the white fondant into a long rope. Twist it into a spiral shape and
                insert a toothpick at the bottom. Stick the horn on top of the cake, in the center of the ring.</li>
            <li>To make the unicorn ears, cut out two triangles from the pink fondant. Pinch the bottom corners of each
                triangle and stick them on either side of the horn, using some water to glue them.</li>
            <li>To add some sparkle, sprinkle some edible glitter over the horn and ears. Your rainbowlicious unicorn
                cake
                is ready to serve and enjoy!</li>
