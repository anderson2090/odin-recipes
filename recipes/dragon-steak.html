        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. Season the dragon meat with salt, pepper, garlic, and herbs. Place it in a
                baking dish and drizzle with dragon blood. Bake for 45 minutes or until the meat is tender and juicy.
            </li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, heat the dragon fire over medium-high heat. Be careful not to burn yourself or set
                anything on fire. Bring it to a boil and then reduce the heat to simmer. Cook until it is reduced by
                half, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In another saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for a few minutes,
                stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the water and the cream. Season with salt, pepper, and magic
                dust if using. Cook until the sauce is thick and smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, slice the dragon steak and pour the fire sauce over it. Enjoy with a glass of chilled dragon
                milk or a potion of your choice. Bon appÃ©tit!</li>
