                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>If you are looking for a spicy and exotic meal, look no further than dragon steak with fire sauce.
                    This dish
                    is
                    made from the finest dragon meat, marinated in dragon blood and baked to perfection. The fire sauce
                    is a
                    fiery concoction of dragon fire, butter, cream, and a pinch of magic dust. This dish will make you
                    feel like
                    a true wizard, as you enjoy the tender and juicy meat with the explosive and creamy sauce. Be
                    warned,
                    though, this dish is not for the faint of heart. You may need a fire extinguisher or a cooling spell
                    to
                    handle the heat. ðŸ”¥</p>

        <h3>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. Season the dragon meat with salt, pepper, garlic, and herbs. Place it in a
                baking dish and drizzle with dragon blood. Bake for 45 minutes or until the meat is tender and juicy.
            </li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, heat the dragon fire over medium-high heat. Be careful not to burn yourself or set
                anything on fire. Bring it to a boil and then reduce the heat to simmer. Cook until it is reduced by
                half, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In another saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for a few minutes,
                stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the water and the cream. Season with salt, pepper, and magic
                dust if using. Cook until the sauce is thick and smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, slice the dragon steak and pour the fire sauce over it. Enjoy with a glass of chilled dragon
                milk or a potion of your choice. Bon appÃ©tit!</li>
